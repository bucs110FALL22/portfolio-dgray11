# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*

My idea was to ask the user the correct name for the digimon based on the image url. If the user guesses the correct name, a random image of coffee will print, if they do not guess correctly, they will not get the coffee image. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*

Prints the entire digimon API instead of one digimon "name"
Does not print the sting for the url from digimon API "img"
Does not print the sting for the url from coffee API "file"

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

Nope

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*

I spent a lot of time and made a lot of effort on this final but I was unable to get the code to work the way I envisioned it to. Thank you.
